# Data-Science Global Summit - NumPy

## "Real-life use case on NumPy; A tool that Every Data Scientist Needs to Master"

You've probably heard of NumPy. It is one of the most important Python libraries and you should almost know or use it for most works. In this session, we are going to take a look on most important features and functions of NumPy that every data scientist should know. This is like a cheat sheet and we are going to teach all the main features one by one by examples.
